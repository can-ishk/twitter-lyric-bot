# twitter-lyric-bot
 
I made this bot to learn more about Python and APIs. It's rather simple: It scans for tweets (every 5 seconds, it can be modified) in which it's mentioned for a spotify playlist link, select a random song and a random lyric and tweets it in reply to the original tweet. It's quite fun if you're a music person.
API keys have to be set in the os environment.
APIs used:
1. Tweepy (Twitter)
2. Spotipy (Spotify)
3. Google Search and Lyrics-Extractor
